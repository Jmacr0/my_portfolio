This repository contains contents for:

## My Portfolio

The main purpose for this application is to implement and showcase the skills I have achieved in software development. This will be displayed through various projects I will be creating during and after my time at Monash Coding Bootcamp.

*As a developer, I want a deployed portfolio so that I can showcase my applications to potential employers and clients.*
